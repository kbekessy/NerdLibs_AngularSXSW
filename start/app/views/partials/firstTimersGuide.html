<p>For first-timers, South by Southwest Interactive can be a little <span>{{template.words.0.word}}</span>. The Austin, TX technology festival, which kicks off Friday, swelled to nearly 30,000 <span>{{template.words.1.word}}</span> last year. This year, there'll be more than 1,000 panels and presentations spread across 13 campuses in an <span>{{template.words.2.word}}</span> crowded downtown.
</p>
<p>
Surviving is one thing, but really <span>{{template.words.3.word}}</span> and <span>{{template.words.4.word}}</span> the fest often depends on what you bring, and just as importantly, don't bring. Here's some advice on what to equip yourself with and what to ditch before you hit SXSW.
</p><p>
Bring: <span>{{template.words.5.word}}</span>. The Interactive schedule is <span>{{template.words.6.word}}</span>, and that's not even counting nighttime parties and unofficial gatherings. It pays to go through the schedule on the official <span>{{template.words.7.word}}</span> and also to skim it on sites such as sxsw.org and sched.org, or sxshhh.com, a new paid site that for $20 rounds up RSVP info for SXSW-adjacent <span>{{template.words.8.word}}</span>
</p><p>
Make a tentative plan for what you want to see and have it handy in a <span>{{template.words.9.word}}</span> or online <span>{{template.words.10.word}}</span> you can access at any time during the fest. The official <span>{{template.words.11.word}}</span> of the fest, "SXSW Go," is available for iOS, Android and soon Windows and BlackBerry <span>{{template.words.12.word}}</span>. I find the <span>{{template.words.13.word}}</span> version is the easiest to browse through, more so even than the SXSW <span>{{template.words.14.word}}</span> itself. It doesn't hurt to double- or triple-book your calendar for panel slots or parties in case a room fills up or if a line is too long. Always leave yourself some extra options.
</p><p>
Don't bring: <span>{{template.words.15.word}}</span>. Once you have a set plan, be prepared to abandon whole chunks of it. You'll meet new people, perhaps find old friends, hear about a great party that's happening or discover that the panel you were dying to attend has been canceled or has reached capacity. Be flexible, go with the flow and have no regrets about missing something; there's plenty to see and do. You'll wear yourself out and miss <span>{{template.words.16.word}}</span> serendipitous moments if you hold too firmly to your schedule.
</p><p>
Bring: <span>{{template.words.17.word}}</span>. A good day at SXSW Interactive is at least 12 hours long, and you might be using your smartphone, tablet or laptop a lot to look up information or try new apps. Your batteries will get depleted, and it's not always easy to find a free power outlet in packed panel rooms.
</p><p>
Bring: charging cables and power supplies for your <span>{{template.words.18.word}}</span>. You can also find cheap, portable <span>{{template.words.19.word}}</span>  chargers for most <span>{{template.words.20.word}}</span> on Amazon for as little as $10 to $1500. Buy at least one, maybe two. A portable <span>{{template.words.21.word}}</span>  wouldn't hurt either if you want to share power outlets with your fellow attendees.
</p><p>
Some years, wireless <span>{{template.words.22.word}}</span> haven't held up under the strain of all the tech-centric <span>{{template.words.23.word}}</span>. Outside the Convention Center in the downtown wilds, there aren't as many free Wi-Fi locations as you'd hope. If what you're doing at the fest requires a constant Internet connection, consider bringing your own <span>{{template.words.24.word}}</span>.
</p><p>
Don't bring: <span>{{template.words.25.word}}</span>. Every year, I hear about someone who had a <span>{{template.words.26.word}}</span>  stolen or lost a <span>{{template.words.27.word}}</span>  containing a memory card full of precious <span>{{template.words.28.word}}</span> that were never transferred to a computer. Keep your stuff safe and don't bring anything <span>{{template.words.29.word}}</span>.
</p><p>
Bring: <span>{{template.words.30.word}}</span>. Texans are very friendly. We want nothing more than for you to go home after your trip and rave about how delicious our barbecue tastes and how we're all as soulful and attractive as the characters on "Friday Night <span>{{template.words.31.word}}</span>." But it only works if you're humble and attitude-free. Which brings us to ...
</p><p>
Don't bring: <span>{{template.words.32.word}}</span>. In recent years, the influx of social media gurus and marketing mavens has changed the vibe at some parts of SXSW Interactive from a spring break for nerds to a focus group for startups aimed at Twitterholics. Leave behind the smarmy business networking and <span>{{template.words.33.word}}</span> attitude toward those who aren't online rock stars. Don't be That Guy (or Gal).
</p><p>
Bring: <span>{{template.words.34.word}}</span>, light <span>{{template.words.35.word}}</span> and a/an <span>{{template.words.36.word}}</span>. March and October are our best weather months in Austin, but it can turn on a <span>{{template.words.37.word}}</span>. Dress <span>{{template.words.38.word}}</span>, but bring a jacket for the colder evenings and have an <span>{{template.words.39.word}}</span> handy in case a thunderstorm rolls through. And wear comfortable, broken-in <span>{{template.words.40.word}}</span> -- you'll be on your feet a lot.
</p><p>
Don't bring: Ostentatious <span>{{template.words.41.word}}</span> and a 10-gallon <span>{{template.words.42.word}}</span>  you only wear when you're visiting Texas. We Texans see right through that <span>{{template.words.43.word}}</span>.
