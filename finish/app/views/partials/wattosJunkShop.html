<p>If you're <span>{{template.words.0.word}}</span> in the Outer Rim Territories and you need spare <span>{{template.words.1.word}}</span> for your <span>{{template.words.2.word}}</span> or other odds and <span>{{template.words.3.word}}</span>, the place to go is Watto's Junk Shop.  Here you can find everything from Robots that jump like Mexican <span>{{template.words.4.word}}</span> Beans to replacement wires for your <span>{{template.words.5.word}}</span> Droid so that it can <span>{{template.words.6.word}}</span> until it blows a/an <span>{{template.words.7.word}}</span>.  Be careful what kind of Money you have in your  <span>{{template.words.8.word}} </span> because Watto dosen't take Republic <span>{{template.words.9.word}}</span>.  You may have to barter with something <span>{{template.words.10.word}}</span> that you own.  The greedy and <span>{{template.words.11.word}}</span> Watto would love to get his grimy <span>{{template.words.12.word}}</span>  on anything that's precious to you. And don't even think about using a Jedi mind trick on Watto - when he says something costs ten <span>{{template.words.13.word}}</span>, you'd beter pay up, or he'll raise the price to <span>{{template.words.14.word}}</span> <span>{{template.words.15.word}}</span> </p>
